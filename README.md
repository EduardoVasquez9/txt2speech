# txt2speech
Python simple text to speech program.

Works with 32bit versions of Python 3.6 and below. 
It will not work on 64bit versions because of the pyttxs3 module which seems to be incompatible. 

Currently working on adapting it to 64bit environments and with Python 3.7 + probably going to make a new repo with a GUI.
